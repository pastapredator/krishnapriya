## (1) Building Products for the Enterprise - Blair Reeves and Benjamin Gaines
![pm.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/pm.jpg)

 
A unique book that starts off on a strong note, defining the expected role of a product manager and describing precisely (how + why) building products for an _enterprise_ is fundamentally different from building _directly with the consumer _in mind.One key takeaway for me was understanding how in my previous roles I had often spent hours obsessing over UI elements, color, layout ..etc When the user may not even be our paying consumer in this case ! This insight is developed further in the preceding chapters developing a clear distinction between the customer and the user ' Gently the readers are lead to concepts of product roadmaps, vision, metrics and each section concludes with a short, insightful interview on an existing product manager from an enterprise. 

So, how does one drive the team as a PM ? The authors posit having sound grasp of three kinds of knowledge - Organization, Product and Industry - it is surprising to note, that business knowledge was not mentioned as a requirement. 

There is a brief the _’Do's and Don’t ‘_ list of communication and team strategies, a few that stick are _‘ Don’t blame an internal team ‘ _
_‘ Be honest and forthright about your product limitations ‘ _ Solid advice. The chapter manages to drill into our minds that the product managers ‘ focus on customer problems ‘ rather than implementing solutions. 

One of my favorite chapters is that of data enabled decisions. 
The authors list out various sources for a PM to consider before evaluating game changing decisions. The key usp also lies in their ability to work across cross functional teams and get stuff done without any formal business authority per se. 

Personally as a fledgling aspirant, this honest line made a mark 

> Product management should not be a first gig in the software industry—this is a highly cross-functional role, which benefits greatly from using prior domain experience.


I rate this book (8/10 ) , as it fundamentally assumes we are in a respectable understanding of our knowledge base and proceeds to dish out practical, high level advice in short nuggets.
