## A List of books to avoid for Product Managers

In my experience, its been super easy to find a recommended list of ' best-books '. But, how about a recommended list of ' Nopes ' ? This is an attempt to list book titles, which in my opinion 'add little or no tangible value' to the reader OR could have simply used a different media format (video, infographic..etc) to convey the same information more effectively.


(1) Obviously Awesome - April Dunford

Bear in mind that my opinions are shaped after reading numerous titles on related subject areas (Ex: [Hooked](https://www.amazon.ca/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/0670069329), [Sprint](https://www.amazon.ca/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/150112174X/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_2/134-6656068-1020141?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=150112174X&pd_rd_r=c803a696-5964-4d67-b5df-726e589d7101&pd_rd_w=qX6vx&pd_rd_wg=Pm4c3&pf_rd_p=9926bb69-42b9-46e4-b788-f665992e326d&pf_rd_r=0FSM3AVMN755R4785H51&psc=1&refRID=0FSM3AVMN755R4785H51) , [Inspired](https://www.amazon.ca/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507/ref=pd_sim_14_4/134-6656068-1020141?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1119387507&pd_rd_r=d171cf2f-15a2-49fb-a2e1-c989634b9e67&pd_rd_w=Bc51t&pd_rd_wg=TzGXH&pf_rd_p=ca0a769f-467a-4dd2-b2dc-9f16d6aac0a1&pf_rd_r=0FSM3AVMN755R4785H51&psc=1&refRID=0FSM3AVMN755R4785H51)) It could have considerably colored expectations/ standards. 


So, where was the mess up ? 
The book covers a much needed void in the Product space, that of ' Product positioning' and the author does a great job of selling it's importance to te reader. ( An entire chapter and half is devoted to  ' How important ' it is )

Moving into what is labelled as the “commandments” of good product positioning, Dunford explains a total of 5 principles:
![obviously awesome category positioning.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/obviously awesome category positioning.png)
The rest of the book explains the five commandments in depth and then explains a _10-step framework_ any business owner or executive can follow to better position their products.

Throughout, there are shared examples of companies, (Examples often lacking references or insufficient data)  In an effort to demonstrate - how positioning  turned companies around from the brink of disaster. In one case involving Janna Systems from near failure against a market leader to an acquisition by that leader for $1.7 billion dollars a few years later.(This is assuming, all was well and dandy with the company, except poor product positioning) 

In essence, if the book could be condensed, a few images conveniently summarize the entirety of its contents. More so, I wish there could be more effort into providing real-world case studies - as ' practice ' excersises for readers or even just by selecting non-trivial examples and proceeding to illustrate or flex Dunford's skills in the field. (One of the analogies / illustrative example was that of a lollipop & cake on a stick, at least in later stages of the book, when the concepts and terminologies are sufficiently familiar to the reader, I wish she would take up more real-world and complext examples to be dealt with) 

After these painful PR chapters, we are lead to the process of ' Creating a product positioning canvas ' - these steps are again based on the 5 commandments, I found the logical organization of the process flow diagram quite clear and easy to follow. 
![obviously awesome positioning identity process png.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/obviously awesome positioning identity process png.png)Here again, I strongly felt there could have been a step-by-step deconsturction from Dunford's own career to illustrate the process. The case studies appear like buzzfeed snipppets, neither do we find references to actual scientific work in this domain(Example http://www.naturalspublishing.com/files/published/rb7p834f32r1gj.pdf - To my surprise...A no-brainer google search yields, far more insightful & organized information than a few chapters in the book combined)

I have gnarling hesitation before leaving a scathing review - personally I understand that the author(s) gets crushed upon receiving negative feedback. However, April makes an exception to this case - The book is the most stellar example of filling in pages and pages of vacuous materials, loosely connected examples (dubbed stories) In fact, one can even find overly positive reviews littered thru out the internet - which seem not even superficially critical of the work or the approach to the subject. 

This book left me wondering, with a dozen questions - What is the domain expertise / maturity level expected of the reader ? What did the author intend this book be labelled as ? A primer ? a coffee table throw away ? Sigh. At the very least, I hope it inspires a few underconfident readers cum authors to compile their own readngs and resourcse to write them up. As there seems to be a LOT of space for mediocrity and a keen reader may just about make the cut above vacuous books such as these...
